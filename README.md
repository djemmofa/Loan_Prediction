# Loan_Prediction
The aim in this project is to built an acurate machine learning model capable to predict whether a loan will be paid off or go in collection. In this project, the following algorithms are developped and tested: K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and, Logistic Regression. With a Jaccard score of 0.87 and a f1_score of .85, the SVM model is the most accurate and them the most suitable to predict whether a loan will be paid off or go in collection.
