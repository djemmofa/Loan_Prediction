# Loan_Prediction
The aim in this project is to built a machine learning model capable to accurately predict whether a loan will be paid off or go in collection. Our dataset is trained and tested with the following algorithms:K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree(DT), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and, Logistic Regression(LR). The accuracy of our models are determined using the Jaccard score and the f_score. The conclusion is that with a Jaccard score of 0.87 and a f1_score of 0.85, the SVM model is the most accurate and them the most suitable to predict whether a loan will be paid off or go in collection.
